# vrt-telemetry-script
In this repository, you'll find the script that I use to check the telemetry for the Valais-Wallis racing team while waiting for the app to be ready.
This script is only for temporary use in the VRT and was made in a few hours on the side of the track on a rainy sunday while working on the car. The quality of the code might represent those conditions, please be understanding.

It contains a few data too, so you can directly test the replay mode if necessary. I'll upload more data later, containing all real-time values, like speed ans temperature.

I'll add more explanation on how the code works later :smile:
